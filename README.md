# Prezly Heartbeat Theme

Prezly Heartbeat theme is our internal newsroom used to share information and updates with the team. 
It is powered by the [Prezly starter theme](https://github.com/prezly/theme-nextjs-starter) and thus running on Next.js.

To style the newsroom we're using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with the new [Just-In-Time compiler](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/just-in-time-the-next-generation-of-tailwind-css).

The newsroom is running within our own infrastructure and guarded by admin login/password combo.

## Documentation

### Commenting

To encourage Prezlians to share/talk/comment on company news every story detail has a link to a discourse comment thread.
The way this works:

* every time you visit a heartbeat story we check if a topic with same title exists in discourse
* if not, we create a topic, with all the story details (converted to html)
* under every Prezly story there is now a link with comments/conversation around that heartbeat post

To enable this set up your discourse API host, API secret, username and category ID. 

### Routes

List of routes we automatically generate:

* **/** : Index page listing stories
* **/[article_slug]** : Article pages with slug provided by PrezlySDK
* **/category/[category:slug]** : Category page listing articles in respective category
* **/sitemap.xml**: Sitemap

### Testing/Token

To ease with development we have created a few sample newsrooms in different categories:

* **The Good Newsroom**: A newsroom filled with good news
* **Cookbook**: Recipes shared by the Prezly team
* **Anonymous Photographer**:  Pictures from a photographer. Combination of albums and imagery

A list of tokens/newsroom uuids that can be used to kickstart the theme.
